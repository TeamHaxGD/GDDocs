|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
gameVersion | Version of the game.
binaryVersion | Version of the client.
gdw | If the request was made by the Geometry Dash World app, this is set to 1; else it's 0.
accountID | A unique ID used to identify players. If the player is not logged in, this is set to 0.
gjp | The encoded password of the player. If the player is not logged in, this is empty.
udid | An alphanumeric ID used to identify unregistered players. This is either based on the device, or generated casually, idk tbh xd
uuid | Yet another ID used to identify unregistered players. Idk how that's generated tbh.
secret | A value used to validate requests. This may vary from endpoint to endpoint, but it doesnt change.
seedX | These are values used by very few endpoints, they are probably some first implementations of the chk, since they follow a pratically identical structure. The X in the name is a number.
rs | "Random seed": as the name says, this is a totally random string, generally used by the chk.
chk | Like the secret, this is also used to validate the requests. However this is generated using an algorithm which is similar for every endpoint but uses different values. Every chk is encoded in this way: `Plain Text + Salt -> sha1 -> Xor -> Base64` The only exception is the chk of the level leaderboard, which hasn't the salt at the end of the string.
